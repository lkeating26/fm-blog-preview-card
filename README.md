## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt some more about custom properties.
I got the font files in woff2 from google-font-helper and used 'font-face'.
I also used pseudo classes on the heading.

### Continued development

I'd like to learn more about custom properties and responsiveness.

### Useful resources

- [Google Webfonts Helper](https://gwfh.mranftl.com/fonts) - This helped me get the woff2 files for the google font.
